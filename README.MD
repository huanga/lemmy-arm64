# Lemmy ARM64 Images

This is mostly for personal use. You're free to use the created images if you want, but I can't promise timely updates, bug fixes, vulnerability fixes, etc. I'll try to keep this up-to-date for as long as I'm using lemmy.

If lemmy starts releasing official ARM64 images again, you should use those instead.

# Build Time

3240s on AMD64 with QEMU on my AMD laptop.
